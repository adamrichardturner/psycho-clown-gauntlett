![](clown-cheerleaders.png)

## Storyline

In a world where societal norms and stereotypical beauty standards run rampant, a teenage girl (she/her) with a confused identity embarks on an unusual journey.

Dreaming of a double career as a wrestler and a cheerleader, she is fueled by passion and determination.

However, her dreams come crashing down when she fails at her cheerleading endeavors - not because of a lack of skill, but because she didn't fit the mold of what society considered "pretty enough", rather she is too masculine.

Represented in the game by a 'baby boy emoji', she is not deterred by this setback.

Instead, she faces an even bigger challenge - a gauntlet of psycho clowns.

These menacing clowns stand between her and the trophy she rightly deserves - a trophy she would have easily won, had the world seen her true worth beyond superficial beauty standards.

But she is not one to be easily defeated.

With 3 lives in hand, she is ready to tackle the challenges ahead, needing only 3 points to claim her victory and prove her worth to the world.

## Game Features

- **3 Lives:** Players start the game with three lives, representing their chances to navigate through the challenges and secure the coveted trophy.
- **Psycho Clowns:** Five clowns with varying abilities, from patrolling a fixed route to predicting your next move, stand in your way. These clowns are not just obstacles, but a representation of societal prejudices and stereotypes.
- **The Trophy:** Representing her dreams and aspirations, the trophy is the ultimate goal. Collect it thrice and win the game, proving to the world the irrelevance of superficial judgments.

## Technology Stack

- **Phaser 3:** The game is built using Phaser 3, a fast, free, and fun open source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games.
- **Arcade Physics:** Provides a simple physics system for the game, allowing for movement, collisions, and other game dynamics.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Allows the player to control the 'baby boy emoji' using arrow keys for navigation.
- **Dynamic Clown Logic:** Clowns in the game employ unique movement logic, from basic chasing to predictive movement patterns, adding a layer of complexity to the gameplay.
